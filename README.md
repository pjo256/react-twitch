This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This is a simple React app that renders Twitch streams for `The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild` written in [typescript](typescriptlang.org).

## Starting the app

To start up the app, you'll need to install npm or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/).

```sh
yarn install
yarn start
```

You'll need an [API key](https://www.twitch.tv/kraken/oauth2/clients/new) from Twitch to get data.
